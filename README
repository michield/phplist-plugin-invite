==========

Invite people to join your phpList system.

v0.1 2013-08-28

requires phpList version 3.0.3 or newer

This plugin will use the campaign system to send a one-off invite to your subscribers.

It does this as follows:

1. in the Send campaign page, there will be an INVITE tab, where you can mark the campaign to be an invitation
2. When you do so, you need to add [CONFIRMATIONURL] to the content.
The confirmation URL will be the place where the recipients can confirm that they want to be in your system.

3. After sending the campaign, the subscriber will be marked "Blacklisted" in the phpList system, which means
no further mails will be sent.

4. When they click the above Confirmation URL, they will be removed from the blacklist
